# C++ Insights Compiler Binaries

This repository holds the macOS and Windows binaries for LLVM and Clang with all libraries enabled required to build C++ Insights.

## Windows

The Windows binaries are a copy of [https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Building-Zig-on-Windows](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Building-Zig-on-Windows). The reason is to have them in one place and control of how long they stay up.

## macOS

For the LLVM 6 to 8 macOS binaries have been distributed via the official LLVM release page (http://releases.llvm.org/download.html#git). However, 9 seems to be delayed with no indication whether it is ever coming. Starting with macOS 9, these are custom builds of my own.
